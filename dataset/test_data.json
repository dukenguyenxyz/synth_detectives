The question was whether the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals granting injunctive relief should be modified to restrain the enforcement of the order of the Board of Tax Appeals as the court had held. It is obvious that a modification of the order would have restrained enforcement of the orders, and the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to render the modification. The court had no authority to modify a decree of the district court, and as the case turned upon whether the orders should be modified to restrain enforcement of them, the decision of the District Court upon that question is conclusive.\""}
