Indeed, the only relevant federal right would have been to intervene, to challenge the denial of the motion. See, e. g., United States v. Wainwright, 430 U.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, an assignee of personal property who elects not to enforce an assignor's lien, under \u00a7 10(a), will nevertheless be responsible for the unpaid debt if the assignee fails to file a timely petition seeking a modification of the judgment.[12] See, e. g., 21 U.

But this case does not involve an assignee of personal property who elects not to enforce the assignor's lien, because respondent has no claim that \u00a7 10(a) bars his equitable claim. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the \"liens of any person... upon property shall attach only to such person.\" \u00a7 10(a)(2).
